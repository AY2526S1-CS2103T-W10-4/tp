title: User Guide
-----------------

ClubTrack is a **desktop app for managing club members and attendance, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while retaining the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

## Target User Profile

ClubTrack is designed for **university student club executive committee (exco) members** who need to:

* Manage large member databases (50–200 members)
* Track attendance across multiple events and sessions
* Assign roles and responsibilities to members
* Monitor member participation through points systems

**Ideal users are:**

* Comfortable with command-line interfaces
* Need to perform member management tasks quickly
* Prefer keyboard input over mouse clicking
* Manage active clubs with regular events and meetings

## Value Proposition

ClubTrack enables club executives to **manage members, track attendance, and assign points up to 3× faster** than traditional spreadsheet-based solutions through an intuitive command-line interface optimized for power users.

## Quick start

1. **Check your Java version**

   ClubTrack requires **Java 17** to run.

   To check your version, open a terminal and type:

   ```bash
   java -version
   ```

   If you do not have Java 17 installed, please download it here:

    * [Windows Installation Guide](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationWindows.html)
    * [Mac Installation Guide](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html)
    * [Linux Installation Guide](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationLinux.html)

2. **Download ClubTrack**

   Download the latest `.jar` file from our [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-W10-4/tp/releases).

3. **Choose a home folder**

   Move the `.jar` file to the folder where you would like ClubTrack to save your data.

4. **Open your terminal and navigate to that folder**

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/folder
   ```

5. **Run the app**

   ```bash
   java -jar ClubTrack.jar
   ```

   A GUI similar to the one below should appear in a few seconds. The app starts with sample data.

6. **Try your first command**

   Type a command in the command box and press Enter to execute it.
   For example, typing **`help`** will open the help window.

   Some example commands you can try:

    * `list` : Lists all members in the current list.
    * `add n/John Doe p/98123456 e/johnd@example.com y/2 f/SOC a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a member named John Doe.
    * `present 1` : Marks the first member as present.
    * `switch Training_2025_10_20` : Switches to (or creates) a list for that event.
    * `clear` : Deletes all members **in the current list**.
    * `exit` : Exits the app.

7. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/Treasurer` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/Treasurer`, `t/Treasurer t/Logistics` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* **List names** used in `switch` and `remove` are plain text strings. Underscores and dashes are allowed, e.g. `Training_2025_10_20`.

- Order of keywords **does not** matter
- A member is returned if **any** of these fields contains **any** of the keywords (logical **OR**)

### Saving the data

ClubTrack data are saved automatically after any command that changes the data.

---

### Editing the data files

ClubTrack stores **each list in its own JSON file** inside the `data/` folder (next to the `.jar`).

- The default list is saved as:  
  `data/default.json`
- When you run `switch Training_2025_10_20`, ClubTrack creates/uses:  
  `data/Training_2025_10_20.json`
- Every list name maps 1-to-1 to a JSON file with the **same name**.

Advanced users may edit these JSON files directly.

> **Caution:**
> - Make sure the JSON stays valid (correct braces, field names, commas).
> - If a file is edited incorrectly, ClubTrack may reset that list or refuse to load it.
> - Do **not** rename the JSON files manually unless you also use the same name in the `switch` command.

---

## FAQ

**Q:** How do I transfer my data to another computer?
**A:** Install the app on the other computer and replace the empty data file it creates with your existing ClubTrack data file.

**Q:** I entered the wrong command. Will it break my data?
**A:** No. Invalid commands are safely ignored, and an error message will appear.

**Q:** The app does not open.
**A:** Ensure you are using Java 17 or above. If issues persist, download the latest `.jar` file and try again.
