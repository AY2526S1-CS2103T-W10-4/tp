# ClubTrack

**ClubTrack is a desktop application for managing club members and attendance, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while retaining the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Whether you're a CCA leader, team captain, or event coordinator, ClubTrack helps you track your members, attendance, and points â€” with less clicking and more doing.

## Features

- **Member Management**: Add, edit, delete, and search club members
- **Attendance Tracking**: Mark present/absent for multiple event lists
- **Points System**: Award and track member participation points
- **Tag System**: Organize members by roles, committees, or status
- **Advanced Search**: Filter by name patterns and tag combinations
- **Multiple Lists**: Switch between different attendance rosters
