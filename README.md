[**AddressBook for University Student Club Exco Members**]

**Target Users:** University student club exco members (responsible for managing member information, attendance & duty rosters). Designed for busy, fast typists who need to update records quickly during the semester.

**Value Proposition:**
- Manage members, mark attendance, assign tags, handle finance, and track duty rosters quickly through a Command Line Interface (CLI).
- Example: Typing `markPresent 'jason'` is much faster than searching for a name in Excel and checking a box.

**Key Features:**
- **Member Management:** Add, edit, and remove members efficiently.
- **Attendance Tracking:** Mark attendance instantly during events or meetings.
- **Tagging System:** Organize members with customizable tags (e.g., roles, interests).
- **Finance Management:** Track payments, dues, and club finances.
- **Duty Roster:** Assign and update duty rosters on the fly.

**Why Use This AddressBook?**
- Natural fit for student clubs: simple contacts + attendance logs + tags.
- CLI benefits: Fast, keyboard-driven workflows for quick updates.
- Easily explainable and manageable for new exco members.

* This is **a sample project for Software Engineering (SE) students**.<br>
  Example usages:
  * as a starting point of a course project (as opposed to writing everything from scratch)
  * as a case study
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _AddressBook_) used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `AddressBook Level 3` (`AB3` for short) because it was initially created as a part of a series of `AddressBook` projects (`Level 1`, `Level 2`, `Level 3` ...).
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Address Book Product Website](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3)**.
* This project is a **part of the se-education.org** initiative. If you would like to contribute code to this project, see [se-education.org](https://se-education.org/#contributing-to-se-edu) for more info.
