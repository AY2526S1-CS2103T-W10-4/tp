[**Tracker for University Student Club Exco Members**]

**Target Users:** University student club exco members (responsible for managing member information, attendance & duty rosters). Designed for busy, fast typists who need to update records quickly during the semester.

**Value Proposition:**
- Manage members, mark attendance, assign tags, handle finance, and track duty rosters quickly through a Command Line Interface (CLI).

**Key Features:**
- **Member Management:** Add, edit, and remove members efficiently.
- **Attendance Tracking:** Mark attendance instantly during events or meetings.
- **Tagging System:** Organize members with customizable tags (e.g., roles, interests).
- **Finance Management:** Track payments, dues, and club finances.
- **Duty Roster:** Assign and update duty rosters on the fly.

**Why Use This Club Tracker?**
- Natural fit for student clubs: simple contacts + attendance logs + tags.
- CLI benefits: Fast, keyboard-driven workflows for quick updates.
- Easily explainable and manageable for new exco members.
